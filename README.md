## Introduction

Hello, This is my reposistory shocasing my learning experience in DevOPs. Here I will go through and list what I have learnt through my time studying DevOPs alonside my contributions.

## Blogs

Here are two blogs I have written based on concepts and tools learned during my course.

[Importance of Scalability and Kubernetes](https://medium.com/@i180437/the-importance-of-scalability-and-kubernetes-14a31f63c6b5)

In this blog, I explain the scalability is and how important it is to maintain. To give a brief summary, scalability is how well a solution or system can funtion when the use case is expanded. Somtimes a solution that works in small scale evironment fails when applied to one that is larger, or in some cases smaller. I also provide real world examples of incidents that could have been avoided if scalability was better handled. Kubernetes was offered as a solution to the problem with its tools to handle scaling automatically. 

[Set-up Auto Scaling](https://medium.com/@i180437/how-to-setup-auto-scaling-in-kubernetes-df4618a9bfdc)

To go alongside my previous blog, the second is guide on how to set up horizontal auto scaling to an application. The guide goes step by step starting with deploying an application, the creation of an horizontal pod auto-scaler and finally traffic simulation.
